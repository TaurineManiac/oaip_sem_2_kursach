# Coursework I from IEF, BSUIR
This C++ banking system implements secure financial operations
with hierarchical access control, demonstrating core programming 
concepts through file-based persistence and efficient
data processing. The console application maintains transaction
integrity between sessions while providing distinct interfaces
for administrators and regular clients. I use in this project 2
my own libraries: for [input validation](https://github.com/TaurineManiac/library_input_check) and [generation data](https://github.com/TaurineManiac/library_generate).
## Main features:

- **Dual-tier Authentication**  
  Role-based access for administrators and regular users with persistent session management

- **Data Persistence**  
  Robust file I/O operations maintain account/deposit records in text format

- **Transaction Lifecycle**  
  Full CRUD operations for deposit management with ownership validation

- **Multi-criteria Sorting**  
  Optimized algorithms for sorting by ID, amount, date, and client parameters

- **Intelligent Search**  
  Context-aware filtering by amount ranges, date periods, and custom identifiers

- **Account Governance**  
  Administrative tools for user account creation, modification, and deletion

- **Input Validation**  
  Type-safe data entry with comprehensive error handling

- **Memory Management**  
  Efficient dynamic allocation for user/deposit datasets with expansion capabilities

- **Many levels of User/Admin menu**  
  It shows the different levels of the function menu for different access levels.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Current limitations:**

1. **User data safety** - Modern programming doesn't use text files, much less without hashing.
2. **Optimization** - library [input_check](https://github.com/TaurineManiac/library_input_check) is too low in current world.
3. **Inconvenient input** - some methods are
supplemented in the program code rather than specified by the 
library, and not all methods are used by their intended purpose.
4. **Using bubble sort** - using this sorting is not rational.

## Main levels of menu:

### 1st level menu of admin/user:
| ‚Ññ | Menu option          | Description                      |
|---|----------------------|----------------------------------|
| 1 | "–í–æ–π—Ç–∏"              | Entrance into an exiting account |
| 2 | "–ó–∞—Ä–µ–≥–∏—Å—Ç—Ä–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å—Å—è" | Register new account             |
| 3 | "–í—ã—Ö–æ–¥"              | Stop program                     |

### 2d level of Admin menu:\
| ‚Ññ  | Menu option             | Description |
|----|-------------------------|-------------|
| 1  | "–î–æ–±–∞–≤–∏—Ç—å –≤–∫–ª–∞–¥"        | Create new banking deposit |
| 2  | "–†–µ–¥–∞–∫—Ç–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å –≤–∫–ª–∞–¥"   | Modify existing deposit |
| 3  | "–£–¥–∞–ª–∏—Ç—å –≤–∫–ª–∞–¥"         | Remove deposit record |
| 4  | "–ü–æ–∫–∞–∑–∞—Ç—å –≤—Å–µ"          | Display all deposits |
| 5  | "–ü–æ–∏—Å–∫"                 | Search deposits by criteria |
| 6  | "–§–∏–ª—å—Ç—Ä–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å"           | Filter deposit list |
| 7  | "–°–æ—Ä—Ç–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å"           | Sort deposits |
| 8  | "–ù–æ–≤—ã–µ –∑–∞ –º–µ—Å—è—Ü"        | Show recent deposits |
| 9  | "–£–¥–∞–ª–∏—Ç—å –ø–æ–ª—å–∑–æ–≤–∞—Ç–µ–ª—è"  | Remove user account |
| 10 | "–î–æ–±–∞–≤–∏—Ç—å –ø–æ–ª—å–∑–æ–≤–∞—Ç–µ–ª—è" | Register new user |
| 11 | "–í—ã—Ö–æ–¥"                 | Exit admin mode |

### 2d level of User menu:

| ‚Ññ  | –û–ø—Ü–∏—è –º–µ–Ω—é | Description |
|----|------------|-------------|
| 1  | "–î–æ–±–∞–≤–∏—Ç—å –≤–∫–ª–∞–¥" | Create personal deposit |
| 2  | "–†–µ–¥–∞–∫—Ç–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å –≤–∫–ª–∞–¥" | Modify personal deposit |
| 3  | "–£–¥–∞–ª–∏—Ç—å –≤–∫–ª–∞–¥" | Delete personal deposit |
| 4  | "–ú–æ–∏ –≤–∫–ª–∞–¥—ã" | View personal deposits |
| 5  | "–ü–æ–∏—Å–∫" | Search personal deposits |
| 6  | "–§–∏–ª—å—Ç—Ä–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å" | Filter personal deposits |
| 7  | "–°–æ—Ä—Ç–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å" | Sort personal deposits |
| 8  | "–ù–æ–≤—ã–µ –∑–∞ –º–µ—Å—è—Ü" | Show recent personal deposits |
| 9  | "–í—ã—Ö–æ–¥" | Logout from system |

## List of Functions:
In order not to clutter it up,
I moved it [here](./ListOfFunctions.md).
